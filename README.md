1. **PROJECT SUMMARY**

| Our design will creatively blend our group's IMY projects together in one website with an outer space theme. We will use theoretical concepts to ensure that the website offers a smooth and interesting user experience, and that the user remains engaged through the inclusion of interactivity and animation. |

1. **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

| **3.1. What are we trying to achieve?** |
| --- |
| Our goal is to showcase our company' previous projects by tying them together into one interactive website that shows potential customer's what we are capable of and provides them with enough information to understand the services we provide and for them to be able to contact us if they are interested in our services. The website itself will also be created in a way that showcases our web development talents, thereby contributing to the promotion of our company. |

| **3.2. Description of overarching theme** |
| --- |
| The overarching theme of our website will be outer space. We chose this theme mainly because of the opportunities it provides to include animation and interactivity into our website's interface. Meteors, asteroids and shooting stars make for animation opportunities that can be used for things such as transitions. An example of how this theme allows interactivity would be that we could have the users fly a little spaceship to different planets representing our different projects.
There are however other reasons for using this theme. A space themed page will naturally be dark. Dark themes are very popular among users since it decreases the strain that users' eyes experience compared to a white theme.(Spink, 2021) Open spaces are also less distracting on dark themes than light ones. This theme will help us with the potential problems of whitespace by allowing us to place stars to fill the emptiness. A poll by an educational support platform called Polar, found that 95% of their users preferred a dark theme over a light one. (Getpolarized) |

| **3.3. Market research on similarly themed websites** |
| --- |
|
**Easy Rocket Studio**
There are several very appealing space themed websites out there. One of which is a site called Easy Rocket Studio. This website has a very high-tech feel to it and it doubles down on this atmosphere by including animations that support it. The content of this site has nothing to do with outer space, proving that the purpose of the site does not necessarily have to be space-related for this theme to be appropriate.(Birch, 2021)

**All I Wish You**
Another space-themed website that exists is called "All I Wish You". This is an interactive page that allows users to leave messages "in the stars" for other users to see. The site then groups together these messages into constellations. Users find this site appealing because they have the power to change or influence the look of the page through their actions. Adding a message and grouping it to a constellation changes the arrangement of the "night sky" background. This causes users to feel more engaged with the site.(Birch, 2021)

| **3.5. Description of the site structure and how it integrates** |
| --- |
| The current idea is to for the background to be one of outer space containing stars and a few planets. Each one of the projects we wish to showcase will then be linked to one of the planets. The user will have control over a little rocket ship that they can fly around on the screen. Visiting the different planets will allow them to open up that project and view it. Flying off the bottom of the screen will scroll down to another section containing information about the services we provide. Flying back up will take users back to the main menu, while flying off the bottom of the screen again will scroll users down to another section containing information telling users how to contact us if they decide to make use of our services. Flying back up from this section will scroll users back to the previous section. |

| **3.6. Description of key features** |
| --- |
| One of the key features of our page will be allowing the user to navigate using their little rocket ship. This makes our page unique and interesting and will keep users engaged and even add a little fun into the usually mundane task of navigating a website. It is crucial that the rocket ship is easy and intuitive to control, to ensure that it adds to the fun instead of causing frustration. Users will then be able to open up, view and interact with the projects we linked to our website. They will need to be able to fully experience the project as originally intended and then navigate back to the home page. |

| **3.7. Description of the image of the company** |
| --- |
| This image we want this website to create of the company is one of talented, creative and fun people who have a passion for content creation in our specific fields. The quality of the website will show that we care about our work and that we know what we are doing. The projects included will show off our talents while introducing users to our style of work. |

| **3.8. Who are we designing for?** |
| --- |
| The people we are looking at as our target market are those who have ideas of things they want to create but lack the technical expertise or time to create it themselves. This includes people who want to create a website, commission a game for development etc. Our target market can also include people who make videos but want them to be edited in a specific way. There are many more possible examples, but it all comes down to people who want something to be created but is unable to do it themselves. |

| **3.9. What goals are we designing for?** |
| --- |
| Users come to our page looking for designers that can deliver a certain service to them. They want to know what we can do in order to determine if we are the right people for the job. If they determine us to be skilled enough to meet their requirements, they want to know how to reach us. Our design is focused on allowing users to quickly and easily achieve these goals, while having a smooth user experience and being entertained in the process. |
